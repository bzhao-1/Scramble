## Description

## Instructions

### App
To run the whole program, go to the `Scramble` directory and use the following commands on the terminal:

```terminal
> docker compose build
> docker compose up
```

Open Docker and click on each port number to view each service.

### Frontend
To run the skeleton of our frontend app, go to the `Scramble` directory and use the following commands on the terminal:
```terminal
> cd frontend
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

### Backend
To run the skeleton of our backend app on the terminal, go to the `Scramble` directory and use the following commands on the terminal:

```terminal
> cd app/backend/cmd/main
> go run main.go
```

The app will be available on http://localhost:8080/


### Languages
The languages section runs separately from the backend part of the game. 

For now, the language section only works through Docker. 

~~To run the skeleton of the language package on the terminal, go to the `Scramble` directory and use the following commands on the terminal:~~

 
<!-- ```terminal
> cd app/languages/cmd/main
> go run main.go
``` -->


~~The app will be available on http://localhost:8000/~~
